CPU Scheduling Algorithm Simulator | C Programming Project

Project Description:
Developed a comprehensive CPU scheduling algorithm simulator in C that implements and demonstrates five fundamental operating system scheduling algorithms: First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin (RR), Priority-based scheduling, and Priority with Round Robin hybrid scheduling.

Key Accomplishments:
• Algorithm Implementation: Successfully implemented five distinct CPU scheduling algorithms with proper task prioritization and time quantum management
• Performance Metrics: Integrated comprehensive performance analysis including average waiting time, turnaround time, and response time calculations for each scheduling algorithm
• Memory Management: Implemented efficient dynamic memory allocation and deallocation for task structures, ensuring proper resource management
• Modular Architecture: Designed a clean, modular codebase with separate components for CPU simulation, task management, and scheduling logic
• Build System: Created a comprehensive Makefile system enabling easy compilation and testing of individual scheduling algorithms

Technical Skills Demonstrated:
• Programming Languages: C programming with advanced data structures and algorithms
• Operating Systems Concepts: Deep understanding of CPU scheduling, process management, and system performance metrics
• Data Structures: Implemented linked list data structures for efficient task queue management
• System Programming: File I/O operations, memory management, and modular program design
• Performance Analysis: Algorithm efficiency evaluation and performance metric calculations

Project Impact:
This project demonstrates strong foundational knowledge in operating systems concepts and provides hands-on experience with critical system-level programming concepts that are essential for understanding how modern operating systems manage process execution and resource allocation.
