# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithm-Simulator-C-Programming-Project
Developed a comprehensive CPU scheduling algorithm simulator in C that implements and demonstrates five fundamental operating system scheduling algorithms: First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin (RR), Priority-based scheduling, and Priority with Round Robin hybrid scheduling.
